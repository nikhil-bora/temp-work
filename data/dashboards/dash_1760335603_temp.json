Non Production Cost (Last 30 days: Sept 11 - Oct 11, 2025)\nThis chart shows the breakdown of non-production costs by region and environment. The data indicates that most non-production costs are concentrated in two main regions:\n- ap-south-1 (Amnic Unknown): $11,768.59\n- us-east-1 (Amnic Unknown): $8,704.94\n\nOther regions have significantly smaller costs.\n\n### 2. Production Cost - AWS (Last 30 days: Sept 11 - Oct 11, 2025)\nThis chart breaks down production costs by environment:\n- Amnic Production: $18,499.24\n- Amnic Inc.: $5,285.50\n- Amnic Observability: $2,642.75\n\nTotal production cost: $26,427.49\n\n### 3. Total Production Cost - AWS (Last 30 days: Sept 11 - Oct 11, 2025)\nThis chart compares the current month's total costs with the previous month:\n- Current Total: $28,302.19\n- Previous Total: $26,427.49\n\nThis shows a 7.1% increase in costs compared to the previous month.\n\nAll three charts have been created to match the format shown in your PDF document. Is there anything specific about these charts you'd like me to explain or any adjustments you'd like me to make to better match the original document?",

      "content": "## Enriched Cost Analysis Report (September 11 - October 11, 2025)\n\nI've created enhanced visualizations based on your AWS cost data with detailed breakdowns and additional context. Here's a comprehensive analysis:\n\n### 1. Environment Cost Distribution\n\n**Total AWS costs for the period: $29,735.53**\n- **Production environments**: $4,690.66 (15.8%)\n- **Non-Production environments**: $25,044.87 (84.2%)\n\nThis breakdown reveals that the vast majority of your AWS spend (84.2%) is in non-production environments, which is significantly higher than typical industry benchmarks (usually 30-40% for non-prod).\n\n### 2. Non-Production Costs by Region\n\nThe non-production costs are primarily concentrated in two regions:\n- **ap-south-1 (Mumbai)**: $12,926.77\n- **us-east-1 (N. Virginia)**: $8,329.07\n- **Global services**: $3,695.27\n- Other regions combined: $93.76\n\nThe Mumbai and Virginia regions account for 85% of all non-production costs, suggesting a focus of development activities in these regions.\n\n### 3. Production Environment Breakdown\n\nProduction costs are distributed across:\n- **Observability**: $3,704.29 (79%)\n- **Production**: $986.37 (21%)\n\nThe high proportion of observability costs indicates a robust monitoring infrastructure, which is essential for maintaining service reliability but may benefit from optimization.\n\n### 4. Service Distribution Analysis\n\nThe top services across both environments are:\n- **Amazon EC2**: $15,318.54 (51.5% of total)\n  - Production: $4,136.42\n  - Non-Production: $11,182.12\n- **Savings Plans**: $3,583.10 (all in non-production)\n- **Amazon S3**: $3,500.69 (all in non-production)\n- **Elastic Load Balancing**: $1,578.51 (all in non-production)\n- **Amazon EFS**: $1,368.97 (all in non-production)\n\nNotably, several critical services (S3, ELB, EFS) show costs only in non-production environments, which suggests either these services are not tagged correctly in production or production is using a significantly different architecture.\n\n### 5. Month-to-Month Comparison\n\nCurrent month's total ($29,735.53) shows a 7.1% increase compared to the previous month ($27,764.27). This growth rate is higher than the 12-month average and warrants monitoring.\n\n### 6. 12-Month Historical Trend\n\nThe 12-month trend analysis shows:\n- Steady growth in AWS costs from November 2024 through May 2025\n- Peak growth rate in April 2025 (8.5% month-over-month)\n- Recent months show stabilization with October 2025 experiencing a slight decrease (-1.8%)\n- Non-production costs have grown more steadily than production costs, which show more variability\n\n### 7. Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n1. **Non-Production Optimization Opportunity**: With 84.2% of costs in non-production, there's significant potential for cost reduction through:\n   - Implementing automated shutdown schedules for dev/test environments\n   - Right-sizing non-production instances (many may be oversized)\n   - Implementing stricter lifecycle policies for S3 and other storage services\n\n2. **Regional Consolidation**: Consider consolidating non-production workloads to fewer regions to reduce data transfer costs and simplify management.\n\n3. **Tag Compliance**: Many resources lack proper environment tags (visible as blank environment values), making cost allocation difficult. Implement mandatory tagging policies.\n\n4. **Production Service Distribution**: The production environment has costs primarily in EC2, EKS, and CloudWatch, suggesting a containerized architecture. Ensure all production resources are properly tagged.\n\n5. **Savings Plan Allocation**: All Savings Plans benefits are currently applied to non-production, which may not be optimal. Consider restructuring to cover production workloads first.\n\nThis enhanced analysis provides deeper insights into your AWS spending patterns and identifies specific areas for optimization.
