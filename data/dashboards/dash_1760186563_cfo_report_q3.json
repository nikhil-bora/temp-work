      "content": "Now that we've gathered all the necessary data, let's create a comprehensive CFO report:\n\n# CFO Financial Report: AWS Cloud Costs for Q3 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n**Q3 2025 Total AWS Spend:** $84,665.29\n- July: $26,819.93\n- August: $28,882.19\n- September: $28,963.16\n- **Monthly Average:** $28,221.76\n\n**Key Highlights:**\n- Total AWS cloud costs increased by 8% over the quarter (July to September)\n- EC2 remains the largest cost component at 47% of total spend ($39,750.72)\n- Savings Plans coverage declined from 46.35% in July to 39.87% in September\n- 100% of resources lack required cost allocation tags (Environment, Project, Team, CostCenter)\n- Q4 2025 forecast shows a potential 18% increase in December costs compared to September\n\n## Cost Distribution by Service\n\nThe top 5 services by cost were:\n1. **Amazon EC2:** $39,750.72 (47.0%)\n2. **AWS Savings Plans:** $10,633.73 (12.6%)\n3. **Amazon S3:** $8,219.07 (9.7%)\n4. **Amazon EFS:** $4,482.05 (5.3%)\n5. **Elastic Load Balancing:** $4,294.23 (5.1%)\n\n## Regional Distribution\n\nOur AWS infrastructure is primarily concentrated in:\n- **ap-south-1 (Mumbai):** $51,221.79 (60.5%)\n- **us-east-1 (N. Virginia):** $22,198.58 (26.2%)\n- **Global Services:** $10,957.67 (12.9%)\n- All other regions: $287.25 (0.3%)\n\n## Cost Optimization Opportunities\n\n### 1. Improve Savings Plans Coverage\n- Current coverage: 39.87% (September 2025)\n- Opportunity: Increase to at least 65% by purchasing additional Compute Savings Plans\n- Potential Annual Savings: ~$14,000 (based on uncovered EC2 spend with 25% discount)\n\n### 2. Tag Compliance\n- Current Tag Compliance: 0% (all resources missing required tags)\n- Top untagged resources by cost:\n  * EFS file system (fs-059fe2bb8b4278c4f): $3,520.68\n  * S3 bucket (prod-ccm-transformed-data): $2,795.05\n  * Load Balancer (istio-ingress): $2,378.76\n- **Action Required:** Implement automated tagging policies and retrospectively tag high-cost resources\n\n### 3. Resource Utilization\n- Several NAT Gateways contribute significantly to costs ($1,507.06 and $933.40 for top two)\n- Multiple EKS clusters at $218.40 per cluster may indicate consolidation opportunities\n- **Recommendation:** Audit NAT gateway usage and consider shared NAT gateways where possible\n\n## Q4 2025 Cost Forecast\n\n- **October 2025:** $21,211.31 (forecast)\n- **November 2025:** $22,384.33 (forecast)\n- **December 2025:** $24,985.03 (forecast)\n- **Q4 Total Forecast:** $68,580.67\n\nThe forecast suggests a potential 13.8% decrease in costs for October compared to September, but with costs rising through December. This forecast should be monitored closely as it may indicate seasonal patterns or anticipated growth.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Improve Cost Allocation:**\n   - Implement mandatory tagging policies for all AWS resources\n   - Configure tag-based cost allocation for proper business unit chargeback\n\n2. **Optimize Compute Costs:**\n   - Purchase additional Compute Savings Plans to increase coverage to at least 65%\n   - Analyze EC2 instance utilization to identify rightsizing opportunities\n\n3. **Storage Optimization:**\n   - Implement S3 lifecycle policies for the top buckets (prod-ccm-transformed-data: $2,795.05)\n   - Review EFS usage patterns to optimize storage tier (current cost: $4,482.05)\n\n4. **Networking Costs:**\n   - Audit NAT Gateway configurations to reduce data processing charges\n   - Consider consolidating load balancers where possible\n\n5. **Budget Planning:**\n   - Plan for approximately $25,000 in December costs based on the current forecast\n   - Allocate approximately $70,000 for Q4 total AWS spend\n\nWould you like me to provide additional details on any specific aspect of this report or create custom KPIs to monitor these metrics on your dashboard?",
