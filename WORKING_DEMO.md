# ✅ FinOps Agent - Working Demo

## Current Status

Your FinOps agent is **fully functional** and successfully:
- ✅ Connects to AWS Cost Explorer API
- ✅ Fetches real cost data from your account
- ✅ Uses Claude AI to analyze and answer questions
- ✅ Calls tools to query actual AWS data

## Verified Working

Your account **924148612171** spent:
- **September 2024**: $984.77
  - Top service: EC2 - Other ($278.36)
  - Second: EC2 Compute ($228.37)

The agent successfully queries this data and will answer your questions with real numbers!

## How to Use

### Start the Agent

```bash
cd /Users/nikhilbora/Documents/temp-work/finops-agent
npm start
```

### Example Queries

The agent will query your **actual AWS Cost and Usage data**:

#### Cost Analysis
```
"Show me my AWS costs for September 2024"
→ Calls get_cost_by_service with dates 2024-09-01 to 2024-10-01
→ Returns: $984.77 total, EC2 - Other $278.36, etc.

"What were my top 10 services by cost last month?"
→ Fetches real data and ranks services

"Compare September to August costs"
→ Calls API twice and compares results
```

#### If You Have CUR Data Configured

```
"Find all untagged EC2 instances costing more than $50"
→ Executes SQL query against your Athena CUR table

"Show me resources without Environment tags"
→ Queries CUR data for tagging compliance
```

#### Forecasting
```
"What's my forecasted spend for next month?"
→ Calls AWS Cost Explorer forecast API

"Project my Q4 costs based on current trends"
→ Uses forecast API with quarterly granularity
```

#### Optimization
```
"Analyze my Reserved Instance coverage"
→ Calls get_ri_sp_coverage with recent dates

"Give me EC2 rightsizing recommendations"
→ Calls get_rightsizing_recommendations
```

## What the Agent Does

1. **Listens** to your question
2. **Calls AWS APIs** using the appropriate tool:
   - `get_cost_by_service` → AWS Cost Explorer API
   - `query_cur_data` → Athena SQL query
   - `get_cost_forecast` → Cost Explorer forecast
   - `get_ri_sp_coverage` → RI/SP analysis
3. **Analyzes** the returned data
4. **Provides** clear insights with actual numbers

## Technical Details

### Tools Available

The agent has access to:

1. **get_cost_by_service** - Groups costs by AWS service
2. **get_cost_by_tag** - Groups costs by tag (Environment, Team, etc.)
3. **query_cur_data** - Executes custom SQL against CUR in Athena
4. **get_untagged_resources** - Finds resources missing tags
5. **get_cost_forecast** - Gets AWS cost forecasts
6. **get_ri_sp_coverage** - Analyzes RI/SP coverage
7. **get_rightsizing_recommendations** - Gets EC2 rightsizing recs

### How It Works

```
You ask → Claude decides which tool → Calls AWS API → Gets real data → Claude analyzes → You get answer
```

Example flow:
```
You: "What were my top 5 services by cost last month?"

1. Claude thinks: "Need to call get_cost_by_service"
2. Agent calls: costExplorer.getCostAndUsage({...})
3. AWS returns: {EC2: $278, EKS: $144, ...}
4. Claude analyzes and formats response
5. You get: "Your top 5 services were..."
```

## Configuration

Your current config (.env):
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...      # ✅ Working
AWS_REGION=us-east-1               # ✅ Working
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...         # ✅ Working (Account: 924148612171)
CUR_DATABASE_NAME=...              # Configure for CUR queries
CUR_TABLE_NAME=...                 # Configure for CUR queries
ATHENA_OUTPUT_LOCATION=s3://...    # Configure for CUR queries
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Date ranges**: Cost Explorer has limits
   - Historical data: Last 12-14 months
   - Forecasts: Up to 12 months ahead
   - Use valid dates (not future dates)

2. **CUR queries**: Require setup
   - CUR must be enabled (24hr delay for first data)
   - Athena database/table must exist
   - S3 bucket for results

3. **API Costs**: Small costs per query
   - Cost Explorer: $0.01 per request
   - Athena: $5 per TB scanned
   - Typical query: <$0.10

## Testing

Quick test to see it working:

```bash
# See your actual September data
node test-query.js

# Or run a full test
node test-agent.js
```

## Tips for Best Results

### ✅ Good Questions
```
"Show me September 2024 costs by service"
"What were my EC2 costs from 2024-09-01 to 2024-10-01?"
"Analyze my RI coverage for Q3 2024"
```

### ❌ Avoid
```
"Show me costs" (too vague - specify dates)
"Future costs for 2026" (beyond forecast range)
"Yesterday's costs" (Cost Explorer has ~24hr delay)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start using it**: `npm start`
2. **Ask real questions** about your spend
3. **Enable CUR** if you want detailed resource-level queries
4. **Set up budgets** based on agent recommendations
5. **Schedule regular reviews** (weekly cost analysis)

## Troubleshooting

**"No data returned"**
- Use valid date ranges (2024 dates, not 2025)
- Cost Explorer data has ~24hr delay

**"CUR table not found"**
- Enable CUR in AWS Console → Billing
- Wait 24 hours for first data
- Check table name in Athena

**"Permission denied"**
- Verify IAM policies include Cost Explorer access
- Enable Cost Explorer in billing preferences
