# How to Run - Python FinOps Agent

## ✅ TESTED & WORKING

I've tested the Python version and it works perfectly! Here's how to run it:

---

## 🚀 Quickest Way (One Command)

```bash
cd /Users/nikhilbora/Documents/temp-work/finops-agent/python-version
./run.sh
```

**That's it!** The script does everything:
- ✅ Creates virtual environment (if needed)
- ✅ Installs all dependencies
- ✅ Launches the agent

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Manual Method

If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the directory
cd /Users/nikhilbora/Documents/temp-work/finops-agent/python-version

# 2. Activate the virtual environment (already created for you)
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Dependencies are already installed, just run:
python3 main.py
```

When done, deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```
