# Latest Updates - October 9, 2025

## Summary
The FinOps agent has been significantly enhanced with three major features:
1. **CUR Table Schema Integration** - Agent knows all 214 column names
2. **Conversation Context Memory** - Natural follow-up questions
3. **Custom Code Execution** - Run Python/JavaScript for advanced analysis

---

## 1. CUR Table Schema Integration ✅

### Problem
Agent frequently used wrong column names, causing query failures.

### Solution
- Fetched complete CUR schema (214 columns) from Athena
- Embedded schema in agent's system prompt
- Added to tool descriptions with examples

### Implementation
- **Schema Fetcher**: `get-cur-schema.cjs` - Queries Athena for table structure
- **Schema File**: `cur-schema.json` - 214 columns organized by category
- **Agent Integration**: Loads schema on startup, includes in every query context

### Benefits
✅ Agent uses correct column names: `"lineitem/unblendedcost"` not `lineitem_unblendedcost`
✅ Knows all available columns (cost, time, service, resource, usage, account)
✅ Better query generation from natural language

### Usage
```bash
# Regenerate schema (if CUR structure changes)
node get-cur-schema.cjs

# Schema auto-loads on agent startup
npm start
# Shows: "Loaded CUR schema: 214 columns"
```

---

## 2. Conversation Context & Memory ✅

### Problem
Agent forgot context between questions, making follow-ups impossible.

**Before:**
```
You: Show me top 5 services by cost
Agent: [Shows results]
You: What about the second one?
Agent: ❌ I don't know what you're referring to
```

### Solution
Intelligent conversation history tracking.

**After:**
```
You: Show me top 5 services by cost
Agent: [Shows: EC2 $1500, S3 $800, RDS $600...]
You: What about the second one?
Agent: ✅ Looking at S3 costs... [detailed S3 analysis]
```

### Implementation
- **History Storage**: Last 10 exchanges (20 messages)
- **Smart Storage**: Only text responses, not tool execution details
- **Auto-Pruning**: Removes oldest when limit reached
- **Error Recovery**: Auto-clears on history errors

### New Commands
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history
- `/history` - View conversation history preview
- `exit` - Quit agent

### Usage
```bash
npm start

# Natural follow-up questions
You: Show me EC2 costs
Agent: [Shows results]

You: Which are underutilized?
Agent: [Understands we're talking about EC2]

You: What's the potential savings?
Agent: [Uses previous context]

# Manage history
You: /history
# Shows last exchanges

You: /clear
# Starts fresh conversation
```

### Files Modified
- `src/agent-simple.js`:
  - Lines 844-845: History storage
  - Lines 850-859: Context-aware message processing
  - Lines 935-948: Smart history saving
  - Lines 994-1016: New commands

---

## 3. Custom Code Execution & Workflows ✅

### Problem
Built-in tools couldn't handle all analytical needs:
- Complex calculations beyond SQL
- Custom report formatting
- Data export to external systems
- Advanced transformations

### Solution
Execute custom Python and JavaScript code with pre-configured AWS SDK.

### Features

#### Code Execution
- **Languages**: Python 3, JavaScript/Node.js
- **AWS SDK**: Pre-configured with credentials
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **File Access**: Read/write to workspace directory
- **Output**: Captured stdout/stderr

#### Workflow Management
- **Save**: Store reusable workflows
- **List**: View all workflows
- **Load**: Load and execute workflows
- **Tags**: Organize by category

#### Workspace Structure
```
workspace/

```

### New Tools

#### `execute_code`
Execute custom code immediately.

**Example:**
```
You: Write JavaScript code to calculate average EC2 cost per hour
Agent: [Executes code with AWS SDK]
Agent: Average EC2 cost: $5.23/hour
```

#### `save_workflow`
Save reusable workflow.

Agent: ✓ Workflow saved: weekly_cost_report.json
```

#### `list_workflows`
View saved workflows.

**Example:**
```
You: Show my workflows
Agent:
1. Monthly Cost Report (javascript)

3. Export to CSV (javascript)
```

#### `load_workflow`
Load and execute workflow.

**Example:**
```
You: Run the monthly cost report
Agent: [Executes saved workflow]
```

### Use Cases

#### 1. Advanced Analysis
```javascript
// Calculate effective hourly rate with discounts
const athena = new AWS.Athena({ region: 'ap-south-1' });
// Complex calculation logic
// Output detailed breakdown
```

#### 2. Custom Reports
```javascript
// Query costs, calculate trends
// Format as JSON/CSV
// Save to workspace/data/
```

#### 3. Anomaly Detection
```javascript
// Compare to historical averages
// Flag unusual spikes
// Generate alert payloads
```

#### 4. Data Export
```javascript
// Query detailed data
// Transform to required format
// Export to CSV for external tools
```

### Pre-built Workflows

- Bucket B: $0.025/GB
- Total: $0.024/GB average
```

**Example 2: Create Workflow**
```
You: Create a workflow to check for long-running instances

Agent: Creating workflow...
Agent: ✓ Saved: long_running_instances_check.json
Run anytime: "Check for long running instances"
```

**Example 3: Export Data**
```
You: Export last 30 days EC2 costs to CSV

Agent: Generating export...
Agent: ✓ Export complete

```

### Implementation Details

**JavaScript Execution:**
```javascript
// Uses .cjs extension (CommonJS)
// Pre-imports:
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Pre-configured:
AWS.config.update({
  region: 'ap-south-1',
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
});
```

**Python Execution:**
```python
# Uses .py extension
# Import as needed:
import boto3
import json

# AWS from environment
athena = boto3.client('athena', region_name='ap-south-1')
```

## 4. Bug Fixes

### EC2 Utilization Always Zero ✅

**Problem**: CloudWatch metrics showed as 0% even for running instances.

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// OLD BUGGY CODE
average: data.Datapoints.reduce((sum, dp) => sum + dp.Average, 0) / data.Datapoints.length || 0
// When length=0: 0/0 = NaN, NaN || 0 = 0
```

**Fix**:
- Proper null handling for zero datapoints
- Dynamic period adjustment based on time range
- Enhanced logging with datapoint counts
- Clear messages for stopped instances

**Files Modified**: `src/agent-simple.js` lines 337-415

# ✓ JavaScript execution successful
# ✓ AWS SDK code execution successful
# ✓ Python execution successful
# ✓ Found 3 example workflows
